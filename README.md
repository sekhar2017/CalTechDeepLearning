In this Project I have Built Deep Convolutional Neural Network for 5 Classes of Caltech 101 Dataset. 

The Training Accuracy is almost 84-85% ! I have used Tensorflow for this Classification. The Test Accuracy almost 60-70% . I have used 280 images of Caltech dataset and augmented them upto more than 6000 images for learning purposes. CaltechAugment.py is the code for augmenting the data.
